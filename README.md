**Overview**

PlantAID is an AI-powered web application designed to assist farmers, gardeners, and agricultural enthusiasts in identifying plant diseases from leaf images. 
By leveraging deep learning models trained on extensive datasets, PlantAID provides real-time predictions along with prevention and treatment recommendations for various plant diseases.

**ðŸ§¬ About the Dataset**  
This project utilizes the Five Crop Diseases Dataset from Kaggle, which comprises images of leaves from five different crops, each exhibiting various disease symptoms. 
The dataset serves as a valuable resource for training machine learning models to identify and classify plant diseases.

ðŸ¥¬ Crops Included:
Corn
Cotton
Grapes
Potato
Tomato
ðŸ¦  Diseases Covered:
Each crop category includes images of leaves affected by multiple diseases. For instance:
Corn: Includes images of leaves with diseases like Northern Leaf Blight, Southern Leaf Blight, and others.
Cotton: Features images of leaves with diseases such as Cotton Leaf Curl Virus and others.
Grapes: Contains images of leaves affected by diseases like Downy Mildew, Powdery Mildew, and more.
Potato: Shows images of leaves with diseases like Early Blight, Late Blight, and others.
Tomato: Includes images of leaves affected by diseases like Early Blight, Late Blight, and others.
ðŸ“¸ Image Format:
Resolution: Varies, typically ranging from 256x256 to 1024x1024 pixels.
Format: JPEG and PNG images.
Annotations: Each image is labeled with the corresponding crop and disease information.
